# Titanic-EDA-ML
A machine learning project that predicts titanic passenger survival. Also performed EDA on it, extensively preprocessed data and used classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN etc. and some hyperparameter tuning using Grid and Randomized Search along with some other classifiers.

Preprocessed the data and performed EDA on it to visualize the various features. Handled missing values, performed normalization and extracted features from it, used StandardScaling.

Used models like, Logistic Regression, kNN, Random Forest, SVC, GaussianNB as well as tuned hyper parameters, using Grid and Randomized Search.

Used Voting Classifiers as well, soft and hard as well as weighted one as well.
